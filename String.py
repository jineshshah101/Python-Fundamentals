# A string is pretty much like a sentence, anything inside the quotations marks is a string, single quote also works for strings

greed = "The Fox Sin of Greed, Sir Ban"
print(greed)

# if you want to print one chosen letter of the string you put it in brackets and say the value you want it to read
# remember numbers start with 0 in programming
